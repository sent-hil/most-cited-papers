# Most Cited Papers

A tool to collect citation counts for scientific papers from Google Scholar. And a server to view them. Mostly generated by Claude.

## Requirements

- Go 1.16 or higher
- SQLite3

## Installation

1. Install Go dependencies:

```bash
go get github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery
go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
```

## Usage

### Collecting Citations

1. Create a markdown file (e.g., `papers.md`) with your paper list using the following format:

```
- Paper Title 1 [[paper](https://link-to-paper)][[code](https://link-to-code)]
- Paper Title 2 [[paper](https://link-to-paper)][[code](https://link-to-code)]
```

2. Run the citation collector:

```bash
go run main.go google_scholar.go papers.md
```

This will:
- Create a SQLite database (`paper_cache.db`)
- Fetch citation counts from Google Scholar
- Display results sorted by citation count

### Web UI Server
```
go run ui_server.go server_main.go [-db=path/to/database.db] -addr=9001
```

Options:
- `-db`: Database file path (default: `paper_cache.db`)
- `-addr`: Server address (default: `:8080`)

2. Open your browser at `http://localhost:9001`

## Notes

- The database caches citation counts to avoid repeated requests.
- For arXiv papers, the tool follows links directly.
- For non-arXiv papers, it searches Google Scholar by title.
